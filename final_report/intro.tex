\section{Introduction and Background}
%With the development of hardware and software of robots,
There is an increasing interest in combining high-level task planning
with low-level motion planning when creating robot controllers \cite{HKG2009,Belta2008,Bhatia2011,Dornhege2009,Erdem2011,Tom2014,Srivastava2014}.
While integrating tasking and motion planning enables users to specify complex robot tasks from a high-level perspective,
combining discrete task reasoning with continuous motion planning brings challenges to designing robot controllers.

Past research has shown promising results on controller synthesis with formal methods \cite{HKG2009,Belta2008,Bhatia2011,Wongpiromsarn,Maly,Vasile}.
In these papers, robot tasks are expressed in formal language such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL).
Controllers can be automatically synthesized from the task specification,
while providing guarantees on the correctness of robot behaviors.
These controller synthesis algorithms typically abstract robot systems and environment by discretizing the robot workspace,
in order to avoid the combinatorial blow up of the state space.
While the abstraction reduces the complexity of mobile systems,
the discretization is usually intractable for manipulation systems,
due to high degrees of freedom of manipulation tasks.

Many frameworks were developed on controller synthesis with formal methods for manipulation \cite{Dornhege2009,Erdem2011,Tom2014,Srivastava2014,CambonAG09,KaelblingL11,PlakuH10,HeLKV15}.
Most of these works utilize AI based planners for high-level task planning and low-level motion planners for finding feasible robot trajectories \cite{Nau,Hoffmann01}.
These frameworks allows user to control manipulation systems with high-level task specifications.
However, high-level planners used in these frameworks limit possible tasks to non-reactive,
i.e. the behavior of the robot does not depend on the state of the environment.

Moreover, formal methods are also used in robotics to generate controllers for coordination of a team of robots \cite{ChenDSB12,KaramanF08,GuoTD14,VasileB14}.
In these work, tasks are specified in Temporal Logic and controllers are automatically synthesized and distributed to each robot agent. 
However, little work has been done on task and motion planning for multi-agent manipulation system with formal method.

In this work, we are interested in developing a framework for automatically synthesizing correct-by-construction controllers
for multi-agent manipulation tasks expressed in Linear Temporal Logic. The framework consists of three main components:
a high-level {\it task planner} for generating and distributing controllers to each agent,
a {\it trajectory planner} for finding feasible path and moving each manipulator while avoiding collisions,
and and {\it action planner} for creating precise motion and actuation for each manipulator.
The framework will be demonstrated with an experiment of two physical Baxter robots assembling a set of modular robots.
