\section{Preliminaries}\label{prelim}
\paragraph{Modular Robots} A modular robot system includes a set of identical or similar mechatronic units in shape and functionality. Each unit is called a module. Modules can be connected and disconnected with each other. The modular robot system studied in this work is the SMORES system \cite{smores}. Since we do not have access to the physical robot for this work, we use mocking modules made of wood and magnets.


\paragraph{AprilTags} AprilTags are 2D barcodes developed for robotics applications by Ed Olson ~\cite{Olson11}. With an existing framework, the position and orientation of any AprilTag in a given image can be automatically detected. In this work we use this system to localize the position and orientation of modules.
