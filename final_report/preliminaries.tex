\section{Preliminaries}\label{prelim}

\paragraph{AprilTags} AprilTags are 2D barcodes developed for robotics applications by Ed Olson ~\cite{Olson11}. With an existing framework, the position and orientation of any AprilTag in a given image can be automatically detected. In this work we use this system to localize the position and orientation of modules.
