\subsection{Problem Formulation}

Given a certain number of modular SMORES robots with randomized initial positions and orientations, assemble the robots into a goal configuration specified by the user.

\subsection{Project Overview}\label{overview}
In this work, we are interested in developing a framework for controlling a Baxter robot to automatically assemble a set of modular robots into a single configuration based on the user defined {\it configuration file}.
Moreover, we aim to provide guarantees for the behaviors of the robot to the user during the planning stage to avoid unexpected or unsafe behaviors.
Specifically, the frameworks includes the following main components:
\begin{itemize}
\item A high-level planner for parsing user defined {\it configuration file} and generate and execute an assembly plan. 
\item A trajectory planer that is capable of moving robot arms to any configuration with its workspace while avoiding collisions.
\item An action planner for creating precise and verified motion to control the end effector of each arm.
\end{itemize}
