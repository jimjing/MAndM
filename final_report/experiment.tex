\section{Experiment}

We ran our system with a Rethink Baxter robot, together with two cameras on its hands and an external kinect for locating the modules to assemble. 

The motion planning leverages the MoveIt! \cite{moveit}, a open-source planning software for manipulation. 


Sensing and localization: We will use existing framework of April Tag (\cite{Olson11}) for detecting and localizing the position and orientation of each wood block.
