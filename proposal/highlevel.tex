\section{Task Planning}
The task planner in this work is based on the framework introduced in (\TODO{hadas paper}).
A robot task specification is expressed in LTL formulas.
Then the specification is automatically transformed to a correct-by-construction discrete controller.
At last, the controller is continuously implemented to generate desired robot behaviors.
Different from (\TODO{hadas paper}), in this work we aim to synthesize controllers for multiple robots executing a manipulation task.
Therefore, there are three main challenges in this work for task planning, as described in the following sections.

\subsection{Specification Language for Multi-robot}



\subsection{Distribute Tasks}

\subsection{Feedback from Trajectory Planner}
