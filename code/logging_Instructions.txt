Hi everyone, I have ported the logging module from LTLMoP to here so it's easier to test.

To use the logger, put the following code in the .py file you would like to use logging (This imports the things needed):

"""
import os, sys
# Climb the tree to find out where we are
p = os.path.abspath(__file__)
t = ""
while t != "code":
    (p, t) = os.path.split(p)
    if p == "":
        print "I have no idea where I am; this is ridiculous"
        sys.exit(1)

sys.path.append(os.path.join(p,"code"))

import globalConfig
import logging
mAndm_logger = logging.getLogger('mAndm_logger')
"""

Now to use it, you can do:

"""
mAndm_logger.log(2,"Sth you want to see")
mAndm_logger.log(4,"Sth you want to see")
mAndm_logger.log(6,"Sth you want to see")
mAndm_logger.log(8,"Sth you want to see")
mAndm_logger.debug("Sth you want to see")
mAndm_logger.info("Sth you want to see")
mAndm_logger.warning("Sth you want to see")
mAndm_logger.error("Sth you want to see")
"""

They are all in different colors!
